        <h3>About the movie</h3>
        <p>
          <strong> Avengers: Endgame </strong>is a 2019 American superhero film
          based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by
          Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,
          it is the direct sequel to Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and the 22nd
          film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and
          Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the
          film features an ensemble cast which includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris
          Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy
          Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai
          Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow,
          and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers
          and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in Infinity War
          which erased half of all life in the universe.

        <h3>Production</h3>
        <p>
          In October 2014, Marvel Studios announced a two-part sequel of
          Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) entitled Avengers: Infinity War. Part 1
          was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, and Part 2 was scheduled
          for May 3, 2019. Marvel's plan was to film both parts of Infinity
          War back-to-back. Anthony and Joe Russo were hired to direct the
          films in April 2015. The next month, Christopher Markus and
          Stephen McFeely signed on to write screenplays for both parts of the
          film. Producer Kevin Feige said that the sequel was titled as two
          parts of a single film because of shared elements but they would be
          "two distinct" projects, not one story split across two films. The
          Russos decided to re-title the two films to remove any misconceptions
          in May 2016, and Marvel left the second film untitled that
          July. Feige and the Russo brothers indicated that the title was
          being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film
          and Infinity War.

        <h3>Box office</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            Avengers: Endgame grossed $858.4 million in the United States and
            Canada and $1.941 billion in other territories for a worldwide total
            of $2.799 billion. It was the highest-grossing film of all
            time until it was surpassed by Avatar (2009) due to the 2021
            re-release in China, and was the second-highest-grossing film
            of all time in the United States and Canada. Gone with the Wind
            (1939) remains the highest-grossing film (adjusted for inflation),
            and Avengers: Endgame is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time
            worldwide
          </p>
          <p>
            The film had a worldwide opening of $1.2 billion, the biggest of all
            time, and nearly double Infinity War's previous record of $640
            million.It is the fastest film to reach the $1 billion and
            $1.5 billion marks, doing so in five and eight days
            respectively.Deadline Hollywood estimated that the film would
            break even five days after release, "unheard of for a major studio
            tentpole during its opening weekend".The website calculated
            Avengers: Endgame's final net profit as $890 million, accounting for
            production budgets, marketing, talent participation, and other
            costs; box-office grosses and home-media revenue placed it first on
            its list of 2019's "Most Valuable Blockbusters"
